# Changelog

## v1.5.6

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed connection fail due to TCP and UDP use same IP and port (map candidate wrongly)
- Fixed handshake HELLO request is dropped if received before connected (add cache logic)
- Fixed connection fails due to ICE lite attribute set in SDP and no manual set ICE lite mode (no need to set)
- Refined comment for SDP and candidate message string structure
- Fixed ICE nominate wrongly if responded XOR mapped address not match local sent candidate even transaction ID matched
- Fixed H264 profile use `4d001f` not match actual device capability

## v1.5.5

### Features

- Added `REMB` RTCP receiver parser and report (no sending `REMB` report to peer)
  - Parser enabled if `on_remb` callback is set
- Added `TWCC` support, both report generate for sender and parsing for receiver
  - User need manually enable `TWCC` use `esp_peer_default_twcc_cfg_t.enable`
  - Can configuration the `TWCC` sending period and control its history cache
- Added support for multiple audio and video codecs through `esp_peer_cfg_t.codec_caps`
  - If not set (default), in SDP only send the codec set in audio/video info
  - If set, when offer SDP, send all codecs that supported by the codec capabilities,
    When answer SDP, only answer the supported ones in peer codec lists
- Added `MJPEG` through RTP support follow RFC2435 (not supported by browser yet)
  - Used for video call by 2 peers, low cpu consume than JPEG over data channel

## v1.5.4

### Features

- Added "PLI" RTCP message handler and callback
- Remove debug abort in sctp

## v1.5.3

- Fixed IDF v6 / mbedTLS 4.1 first-boot DTLS handshake fail (`-0x6e00`): use ClientHello
  reassembly BIO, force datagram transport, per-session timer, and stricter cookie/PSA init

## v1.5.2

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed handshake fail return `-0x7080` on mbedTLS version below than v3.6.6

## v1.5.1

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed leakage caused by DTLS re-setup
- Fixed data channel still create even peer sdp not contain data channel
- Fixed aggressive SCTP resend logic, use exponential resend time as browser

## v1.5.0

### Features

- Added TCP and TURNS support for agent

## v1.4.2

### Features

- Added re-negotiation support when SDP changed during connected
- Add ECDSA 256 support

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed nominate candidate too early when act as controlled
- Treat DTLS role as client when peer send `actpass`
- Treat `MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_CLIENT_RECONNECT` as disconnected
- Fixed un-reliable data channel failed to open due to DCEP message not retransmitted
- Fixed memory leakage due to DTLS resource not free

## v1.4.1

### Features

- Added `esp32s31` target support

## v1.4.0

### Features

- Added ESP-IDF v6.0 support (backward compatible with IDF v5.x)

- RTP port parsing from SDP: Added support for FreeSWITCH WebRTC server compatibility
- Refined DTLS pre-generate certification keys for faster session setup
- Fixed premature ICE nomination
  - Prevented use-candidate attribute from being signaled too early before final nomination

## v1.3.4

### Features

- Added `alive_binding_retries` to configuration binding maximum retries before disconnected
  - Binding retry is a keep alive mechanism to detect peer leave unexpected
- Fixed connectivity check fail if remote candidate not acceptable (TCP etc)
- Added video RTP RTX support

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed peer binding response discard if RTT over 400ms

## v1.3.3

### Features

- Support PLI interval setting so that can control browser key frame send behavior

## v1.3.2

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed auto disconnected from turn server after 10min due to no permission updated

### Features

- Added ICE lite support through configuration `ice_use_lite_mode`

## v1.3.1

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed some turn server fail to connect due to user name too long

## v1.3.0~1

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed esp32c5 library can not build on IDFv5.5.2

## v1.3.0

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed crash caused by receiving SCTP messages before data channel creation
- Fixed incorrect H264 profile usage when controlled by peer
- Fixed race condition in SCTP reference counting
- Fixed misleading fingerprint verification error logs
- Fixed crash due to negative KMS server priority value
- Fixed agent deinitialization while still in use

### Features

- Added RTP transformer support (custom packet processing)
- Added H264 RTP decoder support
- Added IPv6 compatibility
- Added media direction negotiation based on SDP
- Added agent argument validation
- Added receive lock to prevent crashes during concurrent packet processing
- Added weak UDP transport implementation (fallback for unreliable networks)
